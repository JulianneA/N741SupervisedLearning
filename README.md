# N741 Supervised Learning

## Lesson 9: N741 Supervised Learning Methods

Date: 03/15/2017

For this lesson on supervised learning methods we will be working with the `NHANES` package and dataset. See more at CRAN at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHANES/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHANES/index.html).

We will also be using the supervised learning and modeling modules included with the `rattle` package. See more at CRAN at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rattle/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rattle/index.html). There is also a website for the package at [http://rattle.togaware.com/](http://rattle.togaware.com/). `rattle` has a GUI (graphical user interface) similar to `Rcmdr` that makes it easy to use and run many different "machine learning" or "data mining" methods.

## Packages To Install

* Install the `NHANES` package
* Install the `rattle` package

## Code to run

After installing the `NHANES` and `rattle` packages, open "script1.R" and walk through the R code. This will setup the dataset we will be working with in `rattle`. The code also includes the commands to load the `rattle` package and invoke the GUI interface.
